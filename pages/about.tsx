          developer, mainly using Angular 2+. I love coding but hate working in
          an office for 40 hours a week. I was pretty unhappy, it felt like I
          was using up all of my problem-solving abilities and creativity at
          work and my love for coding and creating was fading. */}

          develop their coding skills. Also, since I started tutoring, I have
          really regained my passion for coding and creating things. I have
