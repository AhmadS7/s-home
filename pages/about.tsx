          For about 2 years, I worked full-time for a local company as a web
          developer, mainly using Angular 2+. I love coding but hate working in
          an office for 40 hours a week. Deep down, I was pretty unhappy and I
          was losing my passion for coding and creating things. It felt like I
          was using up all of my problem-solving abilities and creativity at
          work.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black dark:text-white mb-6">
          In early 2022, I quit my job and took a job tutoring at my local
          university. I can now say, I seriously LOVE tutoring. I really enjoy
          building meaningful relationships with students and seeing them
          develop their coding skills. Also, since I started tutoring, I have
          really regained my passion for coding and creating things. I have
          started building things again and am learning new tech such as
          next.js.
